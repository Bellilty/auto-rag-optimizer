configuration:
  chunking:
    chunk_size: 600
    overlap: 180
    strategy: Reduce chunk size to increase diversity and unique sources while maintaining
      context through overlap.
  retrieval:
    method: hybrid
    top_k: 10
    vector_weight: 0.6
    bm25_weight: 0.4
    retrieval_pool: 20
  generation:
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    max_tokens: 500
    temperature: 0.3
reasoning: The chunk size is reduced to 600 words with an overlap of 180 words to
  enhance retrieval diversity and ensure contextual integrity. Increasing the top-k
  to 10 allows for a broader selection of relevant documents. Adjusting the vector
  and BM25 weights to 0.6 and 0.4 respectively reflects a balanced approach, considering
  the performance metrics and the need for improved retrieval scores.
expected_benefits:
- Increased diversity of retrieved documents
- Higher average retrieval score
- Improved contextual relevance
- Better handling of various query types
