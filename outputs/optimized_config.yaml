configuration:
  chunking:
    chunk_size: 500
    overlap: 100
    strategy: Reduce chunk size to improve precision and diversity in retrieval results.
  retrieval:
    method: hybrid
    top_k: 3
    vector_weight: 0.3
    bm25_weight: 0.7
    retrieval_pool: 10
  generation:
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    max_tokens: 500
    temperature: 0.3
reasoning: The proposed chunk size of 500 words with an overlap of 100 words aims
  to enhance the retrieval precision and diversity. Given the analysis shows a complete
  dominance of BM25 in retrieval performance, adjusting the weights to favor BM25
  more while reducing the vector weight reflects the current performance trends. The
  top-k remains at 3 as it aligns with the current retrieval performance without significant
  improvement in scores.
expected_benefits:
- Improved precision in retrieval results
- Increased diversity of sources retrieved
- Better alignment with BM25 performance metrics
