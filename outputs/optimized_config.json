  "reasoning": "The chunk size has been reduced to 500 words with a 150-word overlap to enhance retrieval precision and diversity. This addresses the previous issues of low retrieval scores and lack of diversity. Increasing the top-k parameter to 10 allows for a broader selection of results, which is beneficial given the improvements in chunking. Adjusting the hybrid weights to favor vector retrieval slightly (0.6) while still incorporating BM25 (0.4) reflects the balanced performance observed in the analysis, aiming to leverage the strengths of both methods.",
